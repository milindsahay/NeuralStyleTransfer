# Neural Style Transfer
This repository contains implementation of Neural Style transfer with Tensorflow as deep learning back end framework.
This NST model uses transfer learning on a pre-trained VGG-19 model. Inputs to our model are stored in images folder.
Outputs of our model are stored in outputs folder. Pre-trained model is borrowed from,
unless specified, [deeplearning.ai](https://https://www.deeplearning.ai/).
